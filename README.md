**Current Notes Status:** Have yet to format Lesson 5 and Lesson 6. Making final update for lesson 1 to 4 by 9 March.

**Current Classwork Status:** Have yet to update answers from classwork 2

Follow these steps for the Notes:
1. Download the Notes.qmd file, Datasets and images and store it under 1 folder.
2. Open the Notes.qmd file and render it to generate the html notes for easier referencing. (HTML notes makes the notes more readable and easier to reference from)
   - Note: You may need to download some packages to render. 
   
Note: As this file is constantly being updated, take note of the commits in Github. When I am done with a particular chapter/lesson, I will indicate it as "Final Lesson X, X, X, ... Update". You can simply download the file again or copy over the updated chapters and make your own edits to the chapter.
